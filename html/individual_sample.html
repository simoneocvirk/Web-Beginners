		<br>
		<p>Introduced in 2005, Bridges Cafe was developed from a student-based initiative
		<br>to introduce inclusiveness to the McMaster dining experience. Specialized in
		<br>serving vegetarian and vegan options, Bridges caters to the ideological and
		<br>religious needs of the student body and celebrates the diversity of culture,
		<br>faith, gender, ability, sexual orientation and more, that is present in the
		<br>McMaster community. Bridges is fitted with wireless internet, a comfortable
		<br>seating area and delicious food options, making it a great study location.
		<br>With booking availability and provided sound equipment, this beautifully
		<br>decorated cafe is also the perfect spot to host your team meetings and
		<br>charitable events.</p>
